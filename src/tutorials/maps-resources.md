# DHIS2 Maps & GIS resources

**This page countains useful tutorials and resources about DHIS2 Maps and .**

### Getting help

Please use the [DHIS2 Community of Practice](https://community.dhis2.org) if you have questions about DHIS2 Maps or related geographical information systems (GIS). There is a separate [category for Maps](https://community.dhis2.org/c/implementation/maps/73) under DHIS2 Implementation.

### Configuring DHIS2 Maps

This is how you can configure DHIS2 Maps:

1. **Import geographic data for your organisation units [REQUIRED]** \
   Use polygon gometries for your districts and point geometries for the facilities. This one-time task should be performed by a system adinistrator using the Import/Export app. We recommend you to use the
   GeoJSON format if you use DHIS 2.39 or above. \
   [See documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/exchanging-data/importexport.html#geometry_import)

2. **Signing up for Google Earth Engine [RECOMMENDED]** \
   DHIS2 has a powerful integration with [Google Earth Engine]() allowing you to access detailed datasets for population (WorldPop), building footprints, elevation, land use and climate. These datasets can be freely used by governments and non-profit organisations, and the the sign up process is now very easy. \
